    "* Other tricky bits: Obviously we need to check if a given FEMA string already exists within the summaries dataset. I will need to check whether this is as straightforward as it sounds, or whether...hm. I will have to check whether the potential exists for Summary rows with the same FEMA String to be issued across multiple days...e.g., this string for these three counties is issued this day; then another three rows for an additional three counties are added UNDER THE SAME STRING...this will complicate the checking process.\n",

Counties will match on a combination of state + county code (I could calc that field in the df before I begin...?), and tribal entities will match on...wtf will they match on again...I believe it's a concat of the state FIPS and placeCode...yes because the long tribal codes in the geometries are seven chars...I think. 🥴\n",
